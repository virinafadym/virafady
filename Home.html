    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
       Hi! My name is Virina, and I’m a Software Engineering student with a deep passion for programming, 
       problem-solving, and creating meaningful digital solutions. Since I started studying software engineering,
       I’ve become fascinated by how technology shapes our world and how software can make everyday life easier and more efficient.
       I enjoy learning and working with different programming languages such as C++, Java, and HTML
       I’m always looking for opportunities to improve my coding skills and explore new technologies. Recently,
       I’ve been focusing on building web projects that combine creativity with functionality,
       helping me understand both the design and logic behind modern websites.
       I’m especially interested in software development, system analysis, and web design, and I love turning ideas into real, working applications.
       I believe in writing clean, efficient code and designing systems that are both user-friendly and maintainable.
       My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge in programming and become a professional software developer who contributes to innovative and impactful projects. 
       In the future, I hope to work on large-scale systems that help people and businesses solve real-world problems through technology.
       Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tools, reading about tech trends, and collaborating with others who share the same passion for software and creativity. 
       I believe that learning never stops — and that’s what makes the field of software engineering so exciting to me.
